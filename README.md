Fancy sharing my C program project as part of embedded system study, the program shows how to use data structures , preprocessor directives and pointers.
I will mention my key features which are :
- Structures for sensors redings like temperature and statements of car parts like engine speed.
- preprocessor directives like #if and #define.
- Embedded c extern keyword.
- pointers to access structures.

Manage vehicle control system :
- Turn vehicle engine on or off.
- Control vehicle temperature using AC.
- control engine temperature using engine temperature controller.
- control car speed according to traffic color.
- Set temperature of vehicle and temperature of engine on specific speed using required equation.

Notes:
-sensor readings will be input from user.  
-If engine temperature controller presents so make #define WITh_ENGINE_TEMP_CONTROLLER  TRUE

I will appreciate your attention and comment on this small project.
